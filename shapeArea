//This is really a geometry puzzle, not a programming challenge per se.  However, there's 1 ES6 feature worth highlighting.  Previously, exponents were handled like so:

function shapeArea(n) {
    return Math.pow(n, 2) + Math.pow(n-1, 2);
}

//These days, we calculate exponents with the following syntax:

const shapeArea = n => n**2 + (n-1)**2;
