//Touchy problem because of corner cases.  The foor loop isn't flashy, but it offers several advantages, including completion in a single iteration and the ability to break the loop early if certain conditions are met.  Other approaches using filter/map and possibly .indexOf will probably underperform and be harder to read.

function almostIncreasingSequence(sequence) {
    let invalidCount = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i < sequence.length; i++){
        //identify problem numerals and track occurences.
        if (sequence[i] <= sequence[i-1]) {
            invalidCount++;
        }
        //break loop early if more than 1 problem area, since we can only remove 1 element and stay valid
        if (invalidCount > 1) {
            return false;
        }
        //identify problem numeral that can't be resolved by single removal
